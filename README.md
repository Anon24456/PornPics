# PornPics

# New to programming first "useful" tool
# it has 2 modes
# first mode one gallery mode
# second mode multiple gallery's

# In second mode enter how many links
# you want to download then on the next
# enter press 99

# I wanted to add a third mode
# which downloads all pictures from
# all the gallery's of a pornstar
# but ran into some problems bc
# Pornpics.com has a dynamically
# loading elements
# I know i can use selenium for this
# mode or some other module
# am just gonna leave it like this for 
# a while


# Would be good it you guys gave me some
# feedback, whats good, whats not good about
# my code :)
